# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Async Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications involving unhandled promise rejections within asynchronous request handlers.  The issue arises when an asynchronous operation within a route handler throws an error, but the error isn't properly handled by the Express.js framework, resulting in silent failures.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application with a route handler that uses `Promise`.  A simulated asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation()`) might reject the Promise with an error. However, because the error handling is only done within the `.catch()` block of the promise, Express itself does not know about the error and doesn't handle it gracefully. This can lead to unexpected behavior, and errors may not be logged effectively.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a solution using `try...catch` blocks within the async middleware to handle promise rejections. This ensures that even if errors occur during asynchronous operations, the application continues to run and the errors are logged accordingly.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory using your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install express`
4. Run `node bug.js` and observe the server output. Repeat multiple times. Notice the inconsistencies in error reporting.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js`. Observe the improved and consistent error handling.
